1. Core Marketing Strategy
Marketing strategy defines who you serve, what you promise, and how you win. A useful strategy statement includes:
- Target customer and priority segment(s)
- The customer problem or job-to-be-done
- Value proposition (why you, why now)
- Differentiators (proof, product, process, partnerships)
- Channel approach and budget constraints
- Measurement plan (KPIs, targets, cadence)

A simple way to pressure-test strategy is the “Three Fits” checklist:
1) Problem–solution fit: the offer clearly solves a real, frequent problem.
2) Product–market fit: customers repeatedly buy/renew and recommend.
3) Channel–message fit: acquisition works at a sustainable CAC and payback.

2. The Funnel and What to Measure
Most teams talk about “the funnel,” but measurement breaks when stages are vague. Define stages in your own language and attach a metric to each one.

Example funnel (B2C or B2B):
- Reach: impressions, unique users, viewable CPM, share of voice
- Engagement: CTR, time on site, video completion rate, add-to-cart
- Consideration: product page views, lead form starts, trial sign-ups
- Conversion: purchases, qualified leads, booked meetings, activation events
- Retention: repeat purchase rate, churn, DAU/MAU, cohort retention
- Advocacy: referrals, reviews, NPS, UGC volume

Rule of thumb: optimize one primary metric per stage and use guardrails to prevent “local maximum” behavior (e.g., higher CTR but lower conversion rate).

3. Customer Segmentation (Practical Methods)
Segmentation is how you avoid treating everyone the same. Common segmentation approaches:
- RFM: Recency, Frequency, Monetary value (great for retail and subscriptions)
- Lifecycle: new, active, at-risk, churned, win-back
- Behavioral: categories browsed, content consumed, features used
- Needs-based: what outcome the customer is trying to achieve
- Value-based: LTV tiers (e.g., Platinum/Gold/Silver)

RFM quick guide:
- Recency: days since last purchase/session (lower is better)
- Frequency: number of purchases/sessions in a window
- Monetary: revenue or margin in a window
Practical use: route high-RFM “VIP” customers to loyalty perks; route “at-risk” customers to win-back and service recovery offers.

4. Personalization and Next Best Action
Personalization should be explainable. The safest pattern is: segment → rule-based offers → model-based ranking.

A “next best action” playbook often includes:
- Next best product (recommendations)
- Next best channel (email vs SMS vs push vs paid retargeting)
- Next best timing (send-time optimization)
- Next best offer (discount, bundle, free shipping, trial extension)

Start simple:
1) Build eligibility rules (inventory, compliance, customer preferences).
2) Score options (propensity, expected margin, churn risk).
3) Apply constraints (frequency caps, budget caps).
4) Log outcomes to learn and improve.

5. Offer Design and Promotions
Offers work when they reduce a specific barrier:
- Risk barrier: free trial, warranty, easy returns
- Price barrier: discount, financing, bundles
- Trust barrier: reviews, guarantees, certifications
- Effort barrier: one-click purchase, pre-filled forms

Promotion planning checklist:
- Objective (new customers, reactivation, AOV lift, cross-sell)
- Target segment and exclusion rules
- Offer mechanics (percentage vs dollars, thresholds, bundles)
- Creative angle (one message)
- Timing and frequency caps
- Measurement plan (incremental lift and ROI)

Common mistakes:
- Measuring only last-click conversions
- Discounting customers who would have bought anyway
- Ignoring margin and operational constraints

6. Marketing Analytics: Attribution vs Incrementality
Attribution assigns credit. Incrementality asks: “Did the marketing cause the outcome?”

Useful definitions:
- Attribution: rules or models that allocate credit across touchpoints.
- Incrementality: the causal impact of marketing, typically measured with experiments.

When to use what:
- Use attribution for directional decisions (budget allocation, channel hygiene).
- Use incrementality for high-stakes spend decisions (new channels, large campaigns).

Practical toolkit:
- A/B tests: randomized holdouts to measure lift
- Geo tests: split regions for offline/brand impact
- PSA tests: public service ads as control in paid channels
- MMM: aggregate-level modeling (useful when user-level tracking is limited)

A good habit: treat attribution as “diagnostic,” and confirm big bets with incrementality.

7. A/B Testing and Experiment Design
A/B testing is a decision tool, not a science project. Keep it simple:
- One hypothesis
- One primary metric
- One clear stopping rule

Common experiment types:
- Creative test: headline/offer/CTA
- Audience test: segment targeting
- Landing page test: layout, copy, form friction
- Pricing test: thresholds, bundles

Minimum checklist:
- Randomization and traffic split
- Guardrail metrics (refunds, unsubscribe rate, site errors)
- Sample size estimate or a fixed test window
- Avoid changing multiple variables at once unless you are doing a factorial design

8. CRM Messaging: Email and SMS Best Practices
Email best practices:
- Use a clear subject line that matches the body promise.
- Keep the first 100 characters strong (preheader matters).
- One primary CTA per email.
- Use a preference center and honor opt-outs promptly.
- Track deliverability: bounce rate, spam complaint rate, inbox placement.

SMS best practices:
- Use SMS for urgent, time-sensitive messages.
- Keep it short; include a clear opt-out instruction.
- Respect quiet hours and frequency caps.
- Personalize with context: order status, appointment time, limited-time offer.

Lifecycle flows you can implement quickly:
- Welcome series (3–5 touches)
- Abandoned browse/cart
- Post-purchase education and cross-sell
- Win-back (at-risk → churned)
- VIP perks and loyalty updates

9. KPI Glossary (Common Marketing Metrics)
Core efficiency metrics:
- CAC: Customer acquisition cost (spend / new customers)
- CPA: Cost per acquisition/action (spend / actions)
- ROAS: Return on ad spend (revenue / ad spend)
- MER: Marketing efficiency ratio (revenue / total marketing spend)

Funnel metrics:
- CTR: Click-through rate (clicks / impressions)
- CVR: Conversion rate (conversions / visits)
- AOV: Average order value (revenue / orders)
- LTV: Lifetime value (expected margin over customer life)

Retention metrics:
- Churn rate: percent of customers who stop in a period
- Repeat purchase rate: percent who buy again within a window
- Cohort retention: retention tracked by signup/purchase cohort

Quality metrics:
- Refund rate, return rate, chargeback rate
- Unsubscribe rate, complaint rate, deliverability indicators

10. Handling PII and Data Privacy (High-Level Guidance)
PII (personally identifiable information) must be handled with minimization and purpose limitation:
- Collect only what you need to deliver the service or measurement.
- Store PII securely (encryption at rest and in transit).
- Control access (least privilege) and audit access.
- Define retention periods and delete when no longer needed.
- Use anonymization/pseudonymization where possible.
- Keep consent and opt-out logs, and honor them across channels.

For marketing systems, a practical approach is:
1) Separate identifiers (email, phone) from behavioral events when feasible.
2) Use hashed identifiers for joins.
3) Avoid placing raw PII into LLM prompts or logs.
4) Redact/Mask PII before indexing documents if they can be uploaded by users.

11. Sample Q&A Prompts to Test a RAG Agent
Use these questions to test retrieval, reranking, and grounded generation:
1) “What is the difference between attribution and incrementality?”
2) “How do I design a win-back campaign for at-risk customers?”
3) “List best practices for SMS frequency caps and compliance.”
4) “Which KPI should I use to measure the efficiency of paid social?”
5) “How can I structure a basic A/B test for a landing page?”
6) “What are the common reasons promotions fail to increase profit?”
7) “How should we handle PII in marketing analytics and LLM prompts?”

12. Mini Case Study: Launching a New Promotion (Example)
Scenario: An e-commerce brand wants to increase revenue in the next 2 weeks without hurting margin.

Plan:
- Segment customers: VIP (high LTV), active, at-risk, new.
- Offer: VIP gets early access + bundle; at-risk gets free shipping; new gets first-purchase incentive.
- Channels: email + paid retargeting; SMS only for VIP and cart abandoners.
- Measurement: primary KPI = incremental gross profit; guardrails = refund rate and unsubscribe rate.
- Execution: A/B test subject lines for email; cap frequency to avoid fatigue.
- Post-analysis: compare holdout vs exposed groups to estimate incrementality.
